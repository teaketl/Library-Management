# Library-Management
  For my final project in Computing 2, I chose to create a library system because I work at a museum with a very small library collection, but we’ve always wanted to loan them out to community members. As a result of being so small, we don’t have access to any library programs. Until now that is.

  As stated before, the project focuses on creating a library program for the museum. It will allow users to check in and check out books, so long as they’ve paid their library fees and haven’t reached the max number of books. Users can also browse the book catalog by genre, put a book on hold, extend the hold of a current book, see what books are checked out, and much more. The admin has the ability to enter new books, create new library cards, handle user fees, and more. Alongside these, there will be a way to track a book's status in real time (i.e return by in real life tuesday).
